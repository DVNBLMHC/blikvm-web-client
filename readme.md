- `fix`: fix bug
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: format (changes that do not affect code operation)
- `refactor`: Refactoring (that is, code changes that are not new features or bug fixes)
- `test`: add test
- `merge`: code merge
- `revert`: roll back to a certain commit
- `build`: used to update build configurations, development tools, etc.
- `chore`: Miscellaneous, other non-functional changes

`subject` is a short description of the commit, which is recommended to be no more than 50 characters.
